## Main Menu (NOT FUNCTIONAl, WAIT FOR AUTO ASSIGNMENT)

## What is the objective? (and some lore)

### Controls

- **V** - Crafting Menu
- **C** - Inventory
- **U** - Objectives
- **?** - Configuring Menu

### First Tasks

Start by locating a light-gray ore deposit around the map. (these are the rarest surface deposits!)
Mine it 10 times by clicking the deposit (amount will appear in the top right of the screen)
Once you have 10 Iron Ore, open the Objectives Menu and Click "Rusty Iron Drill".
This will unlock you the Rusty Iron Drill. A primitive starting drill that has a 6% chance to explode and ignite nearby objects.
Place down the drill within 50 studs of an Iron Deposit and watch it extract Iron Ore!
Click the Dropped Iron Ore to collect it.
Then proceed to unlock the Rusty Smelter. (also 6% chance to explode and ignite nearby objects)
This should hopefully provide enough starting info as the game is designed for you to have to learn new mechanics yourself, Not read it off the web.

## Tips for Beginners

- Place Objects smartly, this may seem useless early on, but later into the game this gets important as spaghetti can increase fire chances and lead to tedious managment.
- Think about your unlocks. Prioritize the most required objects you need.
- Dont AFK for too long or else your entire factory might be burned to ash!
