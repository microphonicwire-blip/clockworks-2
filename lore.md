# Game Lore

### Key Names

- **9531-3A** - The Starting Planet
- **GLOBIL** - Who You work for
- **SONAIR** - ???

## Pure lore, (almost) no organization.

You wake up in a crashpod with absolutely no memory of the past. It feels like you were just brought into life, but you seem to have the knowledge of assembling complex machines and everything about said machines.
After the inital shock. You notice that your flying through a planet known as 9531-3A's thick atmosphere as SONAIR has destroyed your mothership above. You notice the Re-entry fires surrounding your pod slowly dissapearing as the clouds start becoming visible.
Now you cant see the clouds and see a vast sandy world, as you grasp the fact your about to crash into an unknown planet, a sudden jolt snaps you into reality, thats your parachute opening then abruptly snapping off your pod, your filled with pure terror
as you fly closer to the sand at impeccable speeds. Then you black out for an unknown amount of time. Once you wake up you realize your flipped over and slowly sinking into the deep sand below. You bash buttons in your pod until the hydraulic door slowly slides open
fast enough for you to escape the sinking pod, just as you get out, the pods door is no longer visible from the surface. So you decide your only option is to escape. But you cant. You take a glance at the terrain infront of you before looking back to only see more sand.
your only hope of survival has sunken beneath the surface. So you wander to a lighter ore deposit thinking its Silver, but after smashing it with some rocks you notice you have an infinite pocket dimension (in your pocket), that can hold anything and everything. And paired
with that is a helmet to view recipes for machines, contents in your pocket dimension, and assigned tasks by GLOBIL. You start to think that this wasnt a tragic accident and is a deployment for GLOBIL's own well being. Suddenly you forget all traces of that thought
almost like something is stopping you. You feel the urge to continue mining Iron. As you mine your 10th piece your helmet displays you can unlock the first machine to start your adventure. You open the objectives menu and unlock the "Rusty Iron Drill". Hastilly designed
by underpaid engineers at GLOBIL, because of that fact, it has a 6% chance to drill itself thus exploding and igniting nearbly structures, which can lead to you burning up and dying.
