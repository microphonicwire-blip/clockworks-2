- **SONAIR** - ???

## Pure lore, (almost) no organization.

# Deployment

The crash pod is screaming. Metal against atmosphere. Fire licking at the viewports. Hands move automatically, checking harness integrity, monitoring hull temperature, calculating descent velocity like this has been done a thousand times. Like this body has done it before. Like someone has done it before.

Outside: orange. Everything is orange. Re-entry flames painting the sky, turning the thick atmosphere of an unnamed world into a furnace. The information surfaces unbidden—the planet, the atmospheric density 2.3 times Earth standard, gravity at 0.97g. SONAIR presence detected somewhere in the orange haze.

SONAIR. The name carries weight. Fear? Anger? The mothership is gone. There's a memory of watching it—no, not a memory. Just knowledge that it was destroyed. The distinction shouldn't matter but it does.

The clouds part below.

Sand. Endless sand. Pale yellow stretching to every horizon like someone took a desert and copy-pasted it across an entire world. No mountains. No water. No green. Just sand and a sun overhead that looks wrong. Too white. Too bright. Like a spotlight instead of a star.

The parachute deploys automatically. 847 meters altitude. The jolt nearly breaks the neck, deceleration slamming ribs into the harness. The chute is visible through the viewport—massive, orange and white, GLOBIL logo printed across its expanse.

SNAP.

The sound is like a gunshot. Like the universe breaking. The chute tears away, ripped free by winds that shouldn't exist at this altitude. It tumbles into the pale sky, getting smaller, disappearing into the haze.

Falling again. Faster.

The sand rushes up and the moment arrives with perfect clarity: death. This body—this meat puppet—will shatter against an alien desert and whatever is inside it will scatter into the sand like—

Impact.

Darkness and pressure and sand in the mouth, sand in the lungs. No—breathing. It's possible to breathe. Why is it possible? The pod is upside down, sinking into the sand like quicksand but slower, more deliberate, like the planet is eating it piece by piece. Movement is necessary. Movement is—

Hands slam against the control panel. Red lights. Alarms screaming. The hydraulic door release—there. Hands hit it three times, four, five, before something hisses and groans and the door slides open with agonizing slowness.

Sand pours in. Cold. Coarse. It's at the ankles, the knees. The door is only halfway open but it's enough. Crawling through, fabric tearing on jagged metal, something cutting deep (blood—yes, blood, red, too red), pulling up and out and onto the surface just as the door slides beneath the sand. The only shelter, the only connection to whatever came before, getting swallowed by this world.

Standing. Legs shaking. Turning in a circle.

Sand.

Turning again.

Sand.

Behind: sand. Ahead: sand. Left: sand. Right: sand and maybe something that might be a shimmer of heat haze but probably just sand.

The pod is gone. Completely gone. There's just... sand where it fell. Undisturbed. Like it was never there.

Part of something—some deep, buried part—whispers: You've done this before.

But that's impossible. There are no memories. There's nothing to—

The helmet. It's been there the whole time, or maybe just appeared. It feels fused to the skull now, part of the skin. The HUD flickers to life, washing everything in pale blue light. Atmospheric composition: breathable. Temperature: 34 degrees. Nearest water: not found. Nearest shelter: not found. Nearest organic life: not found.

Walking begins without conscious decision. One step. Another. The sand shifts beneath the boots, each step sinking a few centimeters before finding purchase. It's hard. Exhausting. But what else is there?

After hours—or minutes, or days; the sun hasn't moved—something glints against the sand. Lighter than the surroundings. Ore deposit, maybe? Silver? The knowledge arrives unbidden, already formed.

Kneeling. Picking up a rock. The rock feels right in the hand. Weighted correctly. Like a thousand rocks just like it have been held before.

Swing.

The ore cracks. Fractures. Pieces break away and—

They disappear.

Not into the hand. Not scattered on the ground. Just... gone. But there's a sense of them. Somewhere. A space that shouldn't exist. In the pocket? No. Beyond the pocket. Through the pocket. A dimension folded into the suit's lining.

The HUD updates: inventory acquired. Iron ore acquired. Storage capacity: infinite.

Infinite. Like everyone has an infinite pocket dimension. Like this is just standard equipment.

Mining another piece. Then another. The motions are automatic. Swing. Collect. Swing. Collect. It feels right. It feels good. Like scratching an itch that nobody knew existed.

On the third piece, something flickers in the corner of the vision.

A task assignment system coming online. Task 001: extract iron ore. Progress: 3 out of 10.

The mining continues. Why does it continue? Water should be found. Shelter should be found. A way off this planet should be found. But hands keep swinging the rock and the number keeps going up and something in the brain releases satisfaction every time it does.

4 out of 10. 5 out of 10. 6 out of 10.

On the seventh piece, clarity surfaces. Sharp. Sudden. Like breaking through water:

This wasn't an accident.

The crash. The SONAIR attack. The destroyed mothership. The convenient crash pod. The convenient helmet. The convenient infinite storage. None of it is accident. This is planned. GLOBIL planned this. They sent—deployed—this thing here. This isn't a rescue mission or colonization or exploration.

This is a job.

Not a survivor. An employee.

The thought crystallizes, terrible and true, and the mouth opens to scream or laugh or cry and—

Something reaches into the skull and plucks the thought out like a weed. The thought disappears. The clarity. All of it. Like it was never there.

A blink. What was being thought about? Something important? No. Iron was being mined. That's what's supposed to happen. Mine iron.

The hand reaches for another ore deposit without permission. Swing. Collect. 8 out of 10. Swing. Collect. 9 out of 10. Swing. Collect.

Task complete.

It's crude. Poorly designed. Misaligned gears. Weak structural supports. Exposed wiring near the drill bit. This thing looks like it was designed by someone who had five minutes and a severe problem with patience.

A footnote scrolls beneath the menu. The drill has a 6% chance of catastrophic failure. Drill bit reversal during operation. Self-drilling. Structural explosion. Thermal ignition of nearby materials. Employee termination—literal. GLOBIL accepts no liability. Use at own risk. Failure to use will result in contract violation and immediate employment termination.

Staring at the text. Reading it again. 6% chance to drill itself and explode. That's not good odds when you're talking about explosives near the face. Near flammable materials.

The iron in the pocket dimension shifts, flows, rearranges. The molecular structures break down and reform. The iron materializes in the hands, already assembled, already complete. A drill about the size of you. Rusty brown metal. Gears grinding audibly even when stationary.

It's ugly. It's dangerous. It's exactly what GLOBIL would make.

The drill is placed on the ground and automatically turns on.

It roars to life, drill bit spinning, grinding into the sand and rock below. Ore pops out, moves off a belt and drops onto the ground. The drill shakes. Rattles. Something loose inside, metal scraping metal.

And a thought surfaces, quiet and persistent: What is being built?

What is GLOBIL building?

Why is this the purpose?

Why can't anything be remembered?

Why won't it let—

The drill keeps spinning. The ore keeps flowing. The sun hasn't moved.

And somewhere, deep in the sand beneath the feet, something else drills back.
